# 📝 Todo App — Project Overview

This project is a fully functional Todo application built with React. It allows users to:

Add new tasks

Toggle tasks between completed and pending states

Edit existing tasks inline

Delete tasks

Filter tasks (All / Completed / Pending)

Persist tasks using localStorage

Use keyboard shortcuts (Enter / Esc) for faster interaction

🎯 Purpose of This Project

The primary goal of this project was skill-building, not complexity.

I intentionally chose a simple and familiar problem (a Todo app) so I could focus on:

Strengthening my React fundamentals

Writing clean, readable JavaScript logic

Understanding state management, derived state, and component responsibilities

Practicing real-world patterns like inline editing, keyboard accessibility, and persistence

I avoided copy-pasting solutions and focused on reasoning through each feature step by step.

🤖 Use of AI

AI was used only for CSS/styling assistance and for writing this readme 😁

All application logic, state management, and component architecture were implemented by me.

This decision was intentional — the goal was to improve problem-solving and React thinking, not just produce a visually polished app.
